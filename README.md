# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and property tax. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using different metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

## 🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses housing dataset.
- Trains a **Linear Regression** model.
- Evaluates model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.
- Visualizes data trends and predictions.
- Can be expanded with additional features or different regression techniques.

## 📂 Dataset
If using the **Boston Housing Dataset**:
- It contains information about houses in Boston, such as:
  - `RM` (Average number of rooms)
  - `LSTAT` (Lower status population percentage)
  - `PTRATIO` (Pupil-Teacher Ratio)
  - `PRICE` (House price - target variable)

If using a **custom dataset**, replace `house_prices.csv` with your data.
